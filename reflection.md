##What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
That many properties from padding, and margin can affect the overall presentation. Border properties are self-explanitory. Even then, there are so many properties, and each property can accept many values that it can be overwhelming. With chrome dev tools, the process of learning all this inner programming vocabulary has been easier.

##What did you learn about CSS positioning?
That it can be aggrevating to position an element the way you want it. Many times it did not work, because other properties like padding, or inline-blocking where selected. It also seemed a little more complicated because once bootstrap or other responsive frameworks, then some properties can be used more frequently than others like div with class="container" or "row" which at times makes the positioning of elements easier than in this challenge.

##What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
Font and color. Positioning the footer at the bottom of the page was difficult because it wouldn't stay on the bottom.

##What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
That we can add CSS by selecting elements that are in a specific tree sequence. Example: `div > ul > li`
