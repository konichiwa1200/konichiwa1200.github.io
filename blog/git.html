        <h3>Benefits of Version Control</h3>
        <p>
            Version control grants us the ability to track changes as a project progresses. In addition, along with the tracking ability, there is also a note taking process that allows for clarity. As a change is performed in the code and tracked by version control, standard good practice dictates the need for descriptive comments to accompany the changes; these comments might result useful in future investigative debugging efforts if committed changes create unwanted or unintended conflicts to a working project. Thus as a result, commit in version control is similar to a snapshot in Apple's time machine, which allows developers to go back in time and see the changes and comments.   
        </p>

        <h3>Git and Tracking</h3>

        <p>
            Git is software that makes keeping track of code changes easy. The idea is that everyone that is working on a project has a local copy of the entire project, and they stay synchronized to a central repository where the owner of the repository approves or declines changes that are submitted by developers working on the project. Git also assists in displaying conflicts in code that arise in the same file. The way it functions is simple: there is a master branch; a state of the project where everyone goes and copies the latest edition of the project. This is like going to the bookstore and buying a book called "Book master edition". Then you go home and read it, making changes where you think it would make sense. These changes can be additions, deletions, rearrangements, etc. When you think you made a nice contribution, you go back to the store and request the author of the book to look over your changes and add them to the book. THe author looks over the changes and determines whether to incorporate your changes, or not. If the author agrees to add the changes, it will then be published to the "Book master edition"; anyone that is also working on the book will want to go back to the store to get a copy of the most recent version of the book. If you deleted something and someone else added a new comment on the same page, Git will alert the owner that there are conflicting changes on a specific page and to please resolve them before the master edition can be updated.
        </p>

        <h3>The Use of GitHub</h3>

        <p>
            Github is a cloud based repository manager service that integrates extremely well with Git. Some benefits of this service is to maintain a remote backup of your project. Additionally, it serves as the central repository where poeple can go to pull the master branch. And finally, its free to use, with paid private repositories, thus allowing up and coming developers to display and craft a portfolio of projects to showcase the community at large.
