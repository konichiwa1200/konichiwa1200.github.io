            <h2>Tech Hubs</h2><span class="date-post-created">1-21-2016</span><br>
            <section>
                <h3>Techonomy</h3>
                <p>
                As everybody knows world wide, Silicon Valley is synonimous with technology insdustry, so much to the point that there is a coined buzzword, "techonomy." The nature of the buzzword rests on the principle that a nurturing and inviting environment to the technology sector becomes an engine of growth for the local, state and sometimes regional economy. As a result of the success that San Fransisco and New York have had, other regions in the States and in the world have taken notice and have taken action to replicate and in hopes surpass the success seen on both coasts of the US.
                </p>
                
                <h3>US Hubs</h3>
                <p>
                To such an extent, other cities in the States have begun to create policies that invite technology companies to set up shop. Last year, Forbes listed 5 cities in the US that were poised for growth to become regional tech hubs. Austin and Dallas, both in Texas, while in the southeast, Miami shines. Chicago represents the north midwest, and Seattle does the northwest. These cities not only have state and local resources being used for the use of the private sector that fosters innovation and risk-taking, but they have or are making in-roads to have in place the infrastructure needed for technology companies to success. Many of us take if for grant it, but realiable electric grid, stable geologic activity, and easy access to the information highway; these are state efforts, while the local efforts rely on the ability for enterpreneurs to have resources like access to incubators/accelerators, good talent, favorable tax code, and affordable cost of living.
                </p>

                <h3>International Hubs</h3>
                <p>
                But the United States are not the only ones that are fostering regions where technology companies can call home, Europe, Asia, Africa, and the America's are also following suit. Places like Tel Aviv, Lisbon, Amsterdam and London are world renowned for their tech scene, but other cities like Sao Paulo, Seoul, Cape Town, and Lagos among many others are also in the race to become a regional technological powerhouse. Places like Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Shenzhen also make the cut. These are regions and cities that are making investments to either attract or retain talent, companies and influence in their respective regions. Like stated above, a successful tech hub needs many things, and globally, regions that have some of the pieces are spending to get the remainding ones. And there is no sign of slowing down.

                <h3>What does this mean?</h3>
                <p>
                The reason to care about these developments is that the technology sector has an explosive growth ahead of itself, and right now is the best time to get into the technology field. Whether it be joining an established company or a startup, or starting your own; the time is now to get in. And for those that are more adventurist and wish to explore, there are great opportunities to take advantage to get a great job and maybe see the world, all at the same time.
