        <h1>SCHEMA</h1>
        <p>
            A schema is the outline of the database and how all of the data is stored in the database. For example, the database that we can see below is composed of two tables, <code>states</code> and <code>regions</code>. Each table has fields (columns) with a name and datatype, i.e <code>id smallint</code>
        </p>
        <pre>
CREATE TABLE states(id smallint, state_name varchar(30), population_density float, population int, region_id smallint);
CREATE TABLE regions(id smallint, region_name varchar(255));
        </pre>
        
        <p>
            and records (rows)
        </p>
        
        <pre>
id          state_name  population_density  population  region_id
----------  ----------  ------------------  ----------  ----------
1           Alabama     96.45               4822023     5
2           Alaska      1.1111              731449      10
3           Arizona     57.05               6553255     8
...
        </pre>
        
        <p>
            Every time we ask for impormation from the database, its called a query. The first example above, our query was about the schema, and the second example was about what did table <code>states</code> contain.
        </p>
    
    <h1>SELECT/FROM COMMANDS</h1>
        <p>
            To perform a query, we use the <code>SELECT</code> and <code>FROM</code> commands. This <strong>selects</strong> the fields <strong>from</strong> the table that you want.
        </p>
        
        <pre>
SELECT state_name, population FROM states;
        </pre> 
        
        <p>
            The above query (question) asks the database to return all of the states and their respective populations from the table named <code>states</code>. The result is shown below (result truncated to conserve space).
        </p>
        <pre>
state_name  population
----------  ----------
Alabama     4822023
Alaska      731449
Arizona     6553255
Arkansas    2949131
California  38041430
...
        </pre>
        <br>

        <h1>FILTERING COMMANDS</h1>
        <p>
            When we perform queries, we rarely want all of the data that is in the database. Instead, we are asking precise questions about the data, and we can use filtering techniques for that. The first technique is to filter by a specific value. For example, if we want to know how many states are from the region 7, we would filter as follows:
        </p>
        
        <pre>
SELECT state_name FROM states WHERE region_id = 7;
        </pre> 
        
        <p>
            That would result in the following output:
        </p>
        <pre>
state_name
----------
Arkansas
Louisiana
Oklahoma
Texas
        </pre>
        <p>
            Or if we want to know which states have a population of 1 to 1.5 million people, we would perform the following query:
        </p>
        <pre>
SELECT state_name FROM states WHERE population > 1000000 AND population < 1500000;
        </pre>
        <p>
            That results in the following output:
        </p>
        <pre>
state_name  population
----------  ----------
Hawaii      1392313
Maine       1329192
Montana     1005141
New Hampsh  1320718
Rhode Isla  1050292
        </pre>
        <br>

        <h1>WILDCARD</h1>
        <p>
            When analyzing data from databases, we want to draw conclusions, and the methods above might be too broad to capture the question that we want to ask. That is were the wildcard (%) symbol comes into play. We can ask more refined questions like include all that match this pattern, or select only those that meet this character. Its another layer of filtering the data, used as a logical operator for characters just like ranges are used for numerical data. Example, if we need to know which regions have "Central" in their name, we would perform this query: 
        </p>
        <pre>
SELECT region_name FROM regions WHERE region_name LIKE "%Central";
        </pre>
        <p>
            Resulting in this:
        </p>
        <pre>
region_name
------------------
East North Central
East South Central
West North Central
West South Central
        </pre>
        <p>
            The wildcard symbol <strong>MUST</strong> be placed on the side of the character that we want to auto-complete. That is, if we use the % sign on the left, like the above, the result will only be of data that end in the word "Central", but if we had <code>"%Central%"</code>, then it would return any records that have the word central in them. We can also use the underscore (_) to look for one character difference like the following example:
        </p>
        <pre>
SELECT state_name FROM states where state_name like "_ew%";
        </pre>
        <p>
            Resulting in:
        </p>
        <pre>
state_name
-------------
New Hampshire
New Jersey
New Mexico
New York
        </pre>
        <p>
            The <code>"_ew%"</code> looks for two things, one character wildcard to the left of the "ew" letters, and zero to many characters wildcard to the right of the "ew" letters.
        </p>
