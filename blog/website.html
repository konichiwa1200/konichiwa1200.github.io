        <h1>Experience</h1>
        <p>
            The journey has been great and full of surprises along with some challenges. The biggest challenge thus far has been to develop the right design. From the beginning, I wanted to design a simple and clean website that would showcase the many future projects that I am going to make. That is why I chose to limit my color palette to black, white, and orange. That way I was not distractd with too much color or how the colors matched. The design I chose was purposefully limited in order to have more flexibility at a later time when I intend to add AngularJS or add more versatility to make it a full web app for managing my projects. 
        </p>

        <h1>Lessons Learned</h1>
        <p>
            By far the biggest lesson has been that a great product takes maticulous planning, and thought to make it beautiful and practical. Take luxury cars, or high end accessories; designers take time to evaluate not only the function of the product but the asthetics, and not sacraficing one for the other. On premium items, elegance is the keyword, thus form and function are symbiotic. That delicate balance is an art, that I came to appreciate first hand when building this webpages.
        </p>

        <h1>Future Outlook</h1>
        <p>
            The key take away, is that at the beginning of this journey, I had no knowledge of any HTML, and after several weeks of hard work, dedication, and patience, I have delivered a website that showcases my skills up to this point. From here, I will now strive to make it cleaner, incorporate additional technologies to make the user experience better, increase the pallete of colors, and striving to make it more elegant.
